# Welcome to the Inspire Agrivoltaics Shading Tool Data Download Training

Here is a collection of Jupyter Journals ready to run in your browser 
through Google Collab and explore the data of the agrivoltaics shading dataset.

Clicking on the rocket-icon on the top allows you to launch the journals on 
[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) for interactive mode.
As per the instructions on each journal, you should uncomment the first line 
that reads `pip install ...`  to install the environment if you follow this mode.

You can also clone the repository and run them locally, from the [U.S. Agrivoltaic Irradiance Database IO page](https://github.com/NREL/agrivoltaics_irradiance_database_io)
